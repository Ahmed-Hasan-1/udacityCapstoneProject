# Udacity capstone project - cloud developer nanodegree
##Overview
The purpose of the cloud developer capstone project is to give you a chance to combine what you've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve your Cloud-related career goals.

In this project, you will build a cloud-based application, and follow the principles of either the Microservices course (course 3) or the Serverless course (course 4). This will help you demonstrate to potential employers and colleagues that you can independently create and deploy applications using these principles.
